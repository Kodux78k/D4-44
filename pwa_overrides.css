/*
 * PWA override styles for Hub UNO.
 *
 * This stylesheet normalises margin and padding on key layout containers. During testing
 * some sections would reset their spacing after navigation or reload. These rules
 * ensure consistent spacing across all views and session components without
 * modifying the original, minified CSS. The `!important` flag is used to
 * override any competing declarations in the bundled stylesheet.
